<P>
This will attempt to describe the internal workings of mp4player for
those that are interested. 
<P>
mp4player was intended as a mpeg4 streaming only player, but since
we were going to handle multiple audio codecs, I made an early decision
to support both local and streaming playback, as well as multiple 
audio and video codecs.
<P>
mp4player (and its derivative applications gmp4player and wmp4player)
is broken up into 2 parts - libmp4player, which contains everything
for playback, and playback control code (for example, in gmp4player, this
would be the GTK gui code).
<P>
There are a few major concepts that need to be understood.  These are
the concepts of a <a href="#session">session</a>, a <a href="#media">media</a>, a 
<a href="#bytestream">bytestream</a>, and a <a href="#decode">decode plugin</a>.
<P>
<div id="session">
<h2>Session</h2>
</div>
<p>
A session is something that the user wants to play.  This could be
audio only, video only, both, multiple videos with audio, whatever.
A session is represented by the CPlayerSession class, which is the
major structure/API of libmp4player.  The CPlayerSession class is 
also responsible for the synchronization of the audio and video classes.
<P>

<P>
<div id="media">
<h2>Media</h2>
</div>
<p>
Each media stream is represented by a CPlayerMedia class.  This class
is responsible for decoding data from the bytestream and passing it to
a sync class for buffering and rendering.  The media class really doesn't
care too much whether it is audio or video - the majority of the code
works for both.
<P>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<P>
<div id="bytestream">
<h2>Bytestream</h2>
</div>
<p>
A bytestream is the mechanism that gives the Media a frame (or a number
of bytes) to decode, as well as a timestamp for that frame.  For example, 
an mp4 file bytestream would read each audio or video frame from an mp4 
container file.
<P>
mp4player supports bytestreams for avi files, mp4 files, mpeg files, 
.mov files, some raw files, and RTP.
<P>
Some bytestreams need to be media aware (meaning they have to know something
about the structure of the media inside of them).  The mpeg file and some
of the RTP bytestreams are media aware; the mp4 container file is not.
<P>
Each media will have its own bytestream.  The bytestream base class resides
in our_bytestream.h.
<P>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<P>
<div id="decode">
<h2>Decode Plugin</h2>
</div>
<p>
Each media must have a way to translate from the encoded data to data
that can be rendered (in the case of video, it is YUV data - for audio, 
it will be PCM - if you need to know what YUV or PCM is, do a web search).
<P>
With this in mind, we have the concept of a decode plugin that the media
can use to take data from the bytestream and pass it to the sync routines.
At startup, decode plugins are detected (rather than hard linked at 
compile time), and the proper decode plugin is detected as the media are
created.
<P>
The decode plugin takes the encoded frame from the bytestream, decodes 
it and passes the raw data to the rendering buffer.
<P>

<div id="flow">
<h2>Media Data Flow</h2>
</div>
<p>
The media data flow is fairly simple:
<P>
bytestream -&gt; decoder -&gt;  render buffer -&gt;  rendering
<P>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<P>
<div id="thread">
<h2>Threading</h2>
</div>
<p>
libmp4player uses multiple threads.  Whatever control is used will have
its own thread, or multiple threads.
<P>
Each media has a thread for decoding, and if it uses RTP as a bytestream, 
has a thread for RTP packet reception (except for RTP over RTSP, which 
will have 1 thread for all media).
<P>
SDL will start a thread for audio rendering.
<P>
Finally, there is a thread for synchronization of audio and video.
<P>
<a href="#top">Back to top</a>
<P>
<div id="render">
<h2>Rendering and Synchronization</h2>
</div>
<p>
We use the open source package SDL for rendering - it is a multiple platform
rendering engine for games.  We have modified it slightly to get the 
audio latency for better synchronization. (Actually, we use the standard SDL
routines, and copy the audio rendering into our own library, which we've added
our audio latency code).  
<P>
The decode plugins will have an interface to a sync class - there are 
both audio and video sync classes, with different interfaces.  audio.cpp and video.cpp contain 
the base classes for rendering - video_sdl.cpp and
audio_sdl.cpp contain the SDL rendering functions.  
These classes provide buffering for the audio and video.
<p>
Audio now has an intermediate base class that we use, located in audio_buffer.cpp and
audio_buffer.h.  This class will take an create a ring buffer from the decoded
audio.  It will then allow callbacks, making hardware specific calls to start/stop/
pause.  It does a bunch more than that, to verify that the audio is being received
correctly, and will add/subtract samples to match output frequency clock drift.
<p>
If someone wanted, they could replace these functions with other rendering engines,
like we did for audio on Mac OSX.  Look at audio_macosx.cpp for more examples.
<P>
Rendering is done through the CPlayerSession sync thread.  This is a
fairly complex state machine when both audio and video is being displayed.
It works by starting the audio rendering, then using the audio latency to 
feedback the display time to the sync task for video rendering.  The SDL 
audio driver uses a callback when it requires more data.  
<p>
We synchronize the "display" times passed by the bytestream with the time of 
day from the gettimeofday function.

<h2>Finally</h2></div>
<p>

To see the call flow to start and stop a session, you should look
at main.cpp, function start_session().
